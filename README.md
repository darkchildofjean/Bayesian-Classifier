# Bayesian-Classifier
This is my version of a Bayesian Classifier. It uses an algorithm that calculates the 
possibilities given all of the values of the different features to come to a conclusion.
This is a supervised learning algorithm. That means that is has a control data set with 
the expected outcomes and uses the probabilities that it gleans from those to make predictions
on the outcome of new data. This particular one makes a prediction as to whether or not a person will
play tennis based on the outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind on a given day.
